I have to admit that the thought of going back to school at 30 was scary. When I first graduated high school I wasnt sure what I wanted to do. I attened some classes, but didnt think I was ready. Long story short, I started my programming journey about 4 years ago and at the time I wanted to be a mobile developer. I started learning Swift and programming small apps for iPhone. About a year later my father passed away and my passion to program went away. I put programming off for a while until I was presented an offer I couldnt refuse. My friend who works for the state found a program for me to get a full ride in any Cal State University. I felt like I was given a second chance in life. I screwed around too much in college after high school, but now with this oppertunity I wont mess it up. 

Now I'm back in college and things couldn't get any better. School is not scary anymore, and in fact I am trying to prove that to myself by facing my fears. Taking that first step into a classroom again felt awkward. Back in the day I never sat in front because I was insecure and didnt want to be picked on to talk. Now I am forcing myself to sit in front and participate more in class.

My first computer science class was called "Intro to Programming". They language they teach is c++. My first thought was how ancient this language was. I have heard of c++, but never used it. In my case I already had experience with code and could understand the basics of c++, but my other class mates didnt know a lick of it.

It felt like I was going back to the basics. The stuff I learned online for Swift was a little difficult to grasp, such as functions, loops, and structures. These concepts I am relearning in c++ make it seem easier than it was. I have dropped Swift from my toolbelt and picked up c++. I think it is a great beginners language to start with. The compile time is one of the fastest and is used by many game developers.
